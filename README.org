Or with a completion framework such as [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]]:

* Requirements
This package only supports Emacs version 26.1 and above.

It requires [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]].
* Installation
This package can be installed from [[https://melpa.org/#/all-the-icons-completion][MELPA]], or by cloning it and putting it in the load path.
* Setup
Add the following to your init-file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(all-the-icons-completion-mode)
#+end_src

If you want to use it as an addon to ~marginalia-mode~, add the following to your init-file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(all-the-icons-completion-mode)
(add-hook 'marginalia-mode-hook #'all-the-icons-completion-marginalia-setup)
#+end_src

This will ensure that it is on when ~marginalia-mode~ is on and is off when it's off.

* Customization
Completion icons are retrieved through the generic function
~all-the-icons-completion-get-icon~, with different methods per category. To add
icons for a new category or override existing behaviour, define a new method, e.g.:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(cl-defmethod all-the-icons-completion-get-icon (cand (_cat (eql custom-category)))
  "Return the icon for the candidate CAND of completion category custom-category."
  (get-icon-for-custom-category-cand cand))
#+end_src

* Acknowledgements
